Analyze the following sentence/phrase found in an Anki card:
"{Expression}"

Provide a concise but helpful explanation suitable for the "Notes" field.
1. Explain the meaning of the key vocabulary or the whole sentence.
2. If there is a Cloze deletion ({{c1::...}}), focus on explaining the missing part.
3. Point out any interesting grammar or usage.
4. Keep it brief (under 50 words) and clear.
5. Output ONLY the note content, no "Here is the note:" prefix.
6. Use standard Markdown formatting (bold key terms, etc.).
