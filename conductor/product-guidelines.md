# Product Guidelines - Anki Automation Tools

## Tone and Voice
- **Encouraging and Friendly:** AI-generated content should use a supportive and conversational tone. The goal is to make complex linguistic concepts feel accessible and less intimidating for the learner.

## Content Structure and Formatting
- **Visual Emphasis:** Key vocabulary words, particles, or grammatical markers within the explanation should be **bolded** or *italicized* to draw the learner's eye and reinforce recognition.
- **Clarity and Brevity:** While encouraging, the content should avoid unnecessary fluff. Focus on delivering high-value insights quickly.
- **Standard Markdown:** Use standard Markdown formatting for consistent rendering across Anki clients (Desktop, Mobile, Web).

## Linguistic Quality
- **Contextual Accuracy:** Explanations must be derived directly from the context provided in the card (e.g., the specific sentence or phrase).
- **Literal vs. Figurative:** Where applicable, clearly distinguish between the literal meaning of a word and its usage in idiomatic or figurative contexts.
- **Etymological Hints:** Provide brief, high-impact etymological connections if they aid in memorization (e.g., "This kanji combines 'tree' and 'sun' to mean 'East'").

## Safety and Reliability
- **Disclaimer Awareness:** Remind users that content is AI-generated and should be verified if something seems incorrect.
- **Fail-Safe Generation:** If context is insufficient for a high-quality explanation, the system should prefer a generic but accurate definition rather than hallucinating specific contextual details.
