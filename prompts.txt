This is a greenfield project. You will have an anki  deck as input (apkg file) and you need to augment it with useful
information. The anki deck is known to have the following fields: Text, Frequency, Notes, Image, Tags.

The task: some of the notes don't have anything in their `Notes` field. I want to fill this out based on the `Text`
field. To do so, I want to use python, any python client (like genanki) and the gemini API.

First come up with a plan for review.
